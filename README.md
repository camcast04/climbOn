## Stretch Goals:

[✅] Has at least 2 data entities (data resources) in addition to the User Model

[✅] Has one entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a  
 One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

[✅] Uses OAuth authentication.

[✅] Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work (typically CUD data operations)

[✅] Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.

[✅] Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished user interface.

[✅] Be deployed online (Heroku).

---

## Nice to have:

[✅] Consume a third-party API.
